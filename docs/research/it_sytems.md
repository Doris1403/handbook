# Research repositories

TODO :

- Makefile, readme, data dictionary
- Docker
- Linters, daff, RStudio: Code Diagnostics
- Preferred formats: md/csv
- The paper template is available [here](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/paper-template)
- Templates for selected Information Systems journals and conferences are available [here](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/templates)

<!-- 
Data checklist:
- [ ] have all raw data been imported?
- [ ] have all raw data been checked (for duplicates, import errors, ...)?
- [ ] create a description/coding_scheme.md describing how the data was collected.
  - When was it collected?
  - By whom was it collected?
  - Which processing steps have been implemented?
  - Save relevant scripts in 1-raw-data.
- [ ] are import procedures deterministic (e.g., creation of artificial identifiers)? This is essential when the data is updated
- [ ] is the csv-format consistent (quotenonnumeric)?
  - when opening and editing csv-files with Calc (LibreOffice), use "Quoted field as text" (Other options) (Make sure this is a default!)
- [ ] if the dataset is too big to be included in the git repository: create a symlink and describe where the data is stored
