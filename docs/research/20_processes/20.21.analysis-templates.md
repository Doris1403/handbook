# 20.21 Analysis templates

Repositories should follow the structure of [Cookiecutter data-science projects](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).

Repositories should contain:

- Makefile, readme, data dictionary
- Linters, daff, RStudio: Code Diagnostics
- Preferred formats: md/csv
- Docker images for the code

Repositories can be hosted on GitHub

- Visibility may initially be set to private
- It is essential **not to publish confidential or copyright protected data** (this may include primary data from surveys, or PDF documents with copyrights owned by publishers)
- Once published, the team decides to swith to public visibility

- Datasets should follow a [tidy data structure](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html#:~:text=Tidy%20data%20is%20a%20standard,Every%20column%20is%20a%20variable.)

- Directory structures
- filenames / column names
- docstrings
- Organizing principles

Data checklist:
- [ ] have all raw data been imported?
- [ ] have all raw data been checked (for duplicates, import errors, ...)?
- [ ] create a description/coding_scheme.md describing how the data was collected.
  - When was it collected?
  - By whom was it collected?
  - Which processing steps have been implemented?
  - Save relevant scripts in 1-raw-data.
- [ ] are import procedures deterministic (e.g., creation of artificial identifiers)? This is essential when the data is updated
- [ ] is the csv-format consistent (quotenonnumeric)?
  - when opening and editing csv-files with Calc (LibreOffice), use "Quoted field as text" (Other options) (Make sure this is a default!)
- [ ] if the dataset is too big to be included in the git repository: create a symlink and describe where the data is stored
