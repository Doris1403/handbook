# 20.29 Writing

## General guidelines

- Revise often
- Ask colleagues for friendly reviews
- Spell-check
- Avoid plagiarism

## Citations and reference sections

Citing allows us to make the results of others understandable and give proper recognition to the authors.
There are two main reasons why we cite: firstly, to respect copyrighted works, and secondly, to adhere to the principles of good scientific practice by appropriately acknowledging the contributions of others.

In information systems or computer science, indirect citation is usually used, as it is more about the theories, studies and results and not about the direct wording.

The following examples use Markdown syntax.
For docx formats, please use a reference manager plugin (such as Zotero).

### 1.1 In the text

For Markdown we use a refernce bib to link quotations and in the text we use the sqaure brakets and than the @ followed by the `ID` we choose in the reference bib.
For example: "[@LeeAnderson2001]"

#### 1.1.1 Indirect Citation

You always have to use your own words for an indirect citation.
In addition to ensure clarity in distinguishing between your own work and indirect citations, it is recommended to use introductory phrases if the formatting and source citation alone are not sufficient.
These phrases help to clearly indicate which content is your own and which is being cited indirectly.

Example for introductiory sentences:

- In the following three sections / chapter I summarize the results of Maier [@Maier2011].
- Müller [@Müller2004, p. 23] distinguishes between [...].

#### 1.1.2 Direct Citation

Direct quotations should be reproduced word for word, including any old spelling or spelling mistakes.
To indicate a direct quote, use quotation marks. For longer quotations of three lines or more, you can format them by indenting, using italics, or setting them in a smaller font.
In such cases, quotation marks are not necessary. If you use German quotes, do not translate them, use only the original

Example:

- „Ein Buch zitieren, aus dem man einen Satz übernommen hat, heißt Schulden zahlen“ [@UmbertoEco1980]

### 1.2 In the Reference Bib
