# 20.29 Writing

## General guidelines

- Revise often
- Ask colleagues for friendly reviews
- Spell-check
- Avoid plagiarism

## Citations and reference sections

Citing allows us to make the results of others understandable and give proper recognition to the authors.
There are two main reasons why we cite: firstly, to respect copyrighted works, and secondly, to adhere to the principles of good scientific practice by appropriately acknowledging the contributions of others.

In information systems or computer science, indirect citation is usually used, as it is more about the theories, studies and results and not about the direct wording.

The following examples use Markdown syntax.
For docx formats, please use a reference manager plugin (such as Zotero).

### 1.1 In-text citations

In-text citations can be parenthetical or narrative (see [APA style](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/basic-principles/parenthetical-versus-narrative)).

- Example *parenthetical* citation: ``Fitness trackers were found to have mixed effects on sedentary behavior (Smith et al. 2006).``
- Example *narrative* citation: ``Smith et al. (2006) analyzed the effectiveness of fitness trackers.``

Word-for-word quotations (parenthetical or narrative) must be identified by quotation marks and a page number must be given:

- Example *word-for-word quotation*: ``For fitness trackers, "a substantial degree of inaccuracy in measuring sleep quality" was found (Smith et al. 2006):``

Parenthetical citations tend to be preferred over narrative citations because they put more emphasis on the content, concepts, or findings instead of the authors. 

In markdown, parenthetical in-text citations are created based on the ``@author2000`` syntax while narrative in-text citations are created based on the ``[@author2000,@author2010]`` syntax ([link](https://pandoc.org/chunkedhtml-demo/8.20-citation-syntax.html)).
The unique IDs (e.g., ``author2000``) are used to link citations to the corresponding elements in the `BibTeX` file.
