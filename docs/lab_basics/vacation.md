- Provide the **required information** (outlined in section 1.2) accurately and completely.
- Submit the **completed form** to the employee's immediate supervisor and the secretary.

- Vacation requests must be submitted at least **1 month in advance** of the desired vacation start date.
- Supervisors will **review and respond to the vacation requests** within **7 business days** of receiving the submission.
- If the requested vacation period coincides with a **peak operational period** or other **scheduling constraints**, employees will be notified promptly to discuss alternatives or adjustments.

### 1.4 Notification of Request:
Upon reviewing the vacation request, the employee will be notified of the decision in a timely manner. The notification process includes the following steps:
- The immediate supervisor or secretary will **inform** the employee whether the vacation request has been **approved or denied.**
- If the request is **approved**, the employee will **receive confirmation** of the approved vacation dates.
- In the case of a **denied request**, the reasons for the denial will be **clearly communicated** to the employee, along with any **alternative options or suggestions.**
- The communication regarding the vacation request will be primarily conducted via **email** or **in-person meetings.**

## 2. Documentation:
### 2.1 Vacation Request Form:
-	Students and researchers **must complete** the designated vacation request form to initiate the vacation process.
-	The **vacation request** form should be easily accessible to employees through the **Intranet**.
- Students and researchers **must ensure** that  **all required fields are filled out accurately and completely**.
- the completed form **must be submitted** to the **supervisor** and/or **secretary** within the specified time frame.

### 2.2 Vacation Entitlement Calculation:
- For **flexible working hours**, which are the normal case, the vacation entitlement is calculated as follows: 

        ((monthly hours / 4.348 ) / 5) x 1.66 x months.
    The result is to be rounded commercially.
- For **regular working hours (fixed weekdays)**, vacation is based on the number of days worked per week. The number of hours does not matter. The statutory vacation entitlement per calendar year is 24 working days (e.g. 20 days for a 5-day week or four days for a 1-day week). The vacation entitlement is calculated as follows:

        (number of months / 12) x (4 x working days per week)
    The result must be rounded up or down!

### 2.3 Vacation Balances Tracking:
- The digital work lab maintains a system to **track employees' vacation balances.**
- Employees **can check their vacation balances** by accessing the [vacation calculation table](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/fileadmin/abt-personal/Homepage_ab_2016-03/11_Formulare_Infos_Merkblaetter/Urlaubsantrag_f%C3%BCr_wissenschaftliche_Besch%C3%A4ftigte/Urlaubsberechnung.xlsx)
- The vacation calculation table displays the **current available vacation days** and any **carry-over** or **accrual information**.
- It is the employees' responsibility to ensure they have **sufficient vacation days available** before submitting a request.

###  3.4 Handover Procedures

The Supervisor is responsible for the handover procedures

- **Communication and briefing:** Prior to the researcher's holiday, they should schedule a meeting with the team members to discuss the ongoing projects, tasks, and any pending deadlines. They should communicate any critical information, potential challenges, and specific instructions for handling various scenarios.

- **Documenting project details:** The researcher should ensure that all project-related information is documented and organized in a central location. The team members should have access to this documentation. Additionally, the researcher should clearly outline the responsibilities and roles of each team member during the handover period.

## 4. Exceptions and Special Circumstances

### 4.1 Extended Leaves of Absence
- **Student Assistants** may, upon application, be released from the obligation of proper study (leave of absence). This must be approved by the management of the digital-work lab.

  The reasons for the leave of absence must be stated in writing in the application and must be supported by appropriate evidence.

  The reason for the leave of absence must cover at least six weeks of the lecture period.

- No extension of leave is possible for **researchers/supervisors**.


### 5.2 Emergency Situations

- During emergency situations when an important team member is on vacation, it is crucial to have a plan in place. The first step is to identify a designated **backup or point of contact** who can assume the responsibilities and decision-making authority of the absent team member.
- This backup should be well-informed about the ongoing projects, possess the necessary expertise, and be able to make critical decisions in the absence of the vacationing team member.

### 5.3 Changes in Vacation Plans

When changes need to be made to the vacation plan, **open and transparent communication is key**.
The team member should promptly notify their supervisor/Researcher about the change, providing a clear explanation and any necessary documentation, and work collaboratively to adjust the plan.
