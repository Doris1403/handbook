# 30.10 Course organization

Create a new course: have it added to Flexnow (Modulkatalog).

**TODO:**

- Link to template/issues
- Use the same template for projects/seminars?
- Scheine ([Formular](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/ism/studium/anmeldung-scheinklausur/)), Scheinklausur-anmeldungen bei Erstellung der Klausurbögen berücksichtigen

To organize a lecture, we use the **lecture** issue template ([overview](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/handbook/labels/lecture)).

## 3. Offer the course

- Secretary: Order exam materials (Prüfungspapier, Mantelbögen).
- Professor (Secretary): Prepare the exams (Deadline: day of the exam), information is typically provided one month before the semester ends (E-Mail: "Prüferbestellung"). Check whether points add up, whether the number of points per task is consistent with the grading expectations - e.g., "list two examples" should correspond to 2 or 4 points. (**TODO: where to store the exam**). Review the exam for typos. Print it and prepare the exam materials. Add the date of the exam to the calendar and prepare to hand it over personally.

## 4. Exams and documentation

- Professor: Grade exams (adding bonus points if any, do not grade "vorbehaltlich geschriebene Klausuren"/"Unterschleif", do not dispose of empty exams, have failed exams reviewed by a second professor), deadline: approx. 15. September (summer term), ??? (winter term).

- Professor: Analyse the evaluations and store the files (**TODO : owncloud/teaching/...**).
- Professor: Document teaching efforts ([TODO : add link](..)), add it to the PDF archive, and submit documentation to the Dean's office ([Lehrverpflichtung](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/abt-personal/formulare-infos-und-merkblaetter/)).

Deadline: End of August (summer term), March (winter term)

## 5. Repeat exam (following term)

Students have the possibility to repeat the exam in the following term (even if the lecture is not offered again). Registration for students in FlexNOW is created by the examination office. (true???)
