# 30.60 Reviews and appeals

This is the process for students to appeal against their grades for centrally organized exams and other exams (e.g. thesis, projects and seminars)

## Centrally organized exams

For exams that are organized centrally, students can attend the "Reviewing Examination Results Date", which can be found on this website: "https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/studies/currently-enrolled/office-of-examinations/translate-to-1-english-einsichtnahmen/". 

During these reviewing days, we encourage students to take notes and photographs of the exam. If students notice any discrepancies, they can write down their observations on a separate piece of paper and take pictures. 

After the reviewing days, students can send an email to the responsible chair and request a correction, but only if they can specifically identify the questions and provide a picture of the exam task that requires correction.

Afterwards, the chair determines whether a post-correction is necessary based on the description and picture, and informs the student via email.

## Other exams

For projects, seminars, and theses, feedback and comments are part of the process. You can ask to review the grading of your work and discuss potential corrections.
