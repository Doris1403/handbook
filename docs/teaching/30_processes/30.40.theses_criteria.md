# Theses: Evaluation criteria

Bachelor's and Master's theses are evaluated according to the same criteria.
Once the **formal requirements** are met, the **main criteria** related to the process, the contribution, and the discussion are used to grade a thesis.

A Bachelor's thesis should cover 20-40 pages (roughly 8,000 - 16,000 words), while a Master's thesis should cover 30-70 pages (roughly 12,000 - 28,000 words).
Formal and quantitative theses are typically shorter than qualitative and literature-based ones.
For a Master's thesis, a presentation is required and a more substantial contribution is expected in line with the higher number of ECTS credits earned.

## Formal requirements

- Written in proper academic English, with a clear structure and line of argument
- Follows citation practices, using [APA format](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples), and refers primarily to peer-reviewed academic papers
- Includes a title page, table-of-contents, abstract, common sections (e.g., IMRAD), a reference section, and appendices (if applicable)
- Makes appropriate use of tables and figures

## Main criteria

The **process** is evaluated according to the following criteria:

- Proficiency in leveraging prior research, i.e., identifying relevant papers, achieving an appropriate understanding, assessing contributions critically, organizing prior work in a persuasive way to clarify how the thesis builds on prior work and how it goes beyond prior work
- Systematicity in managing time, resources, and challenges 
- Proactiveness in developing the topic (research question, theory, method, etc.), and incorporating feedback

The **contribution** is evaluated based on several dimensions (based on Leidner 2020):

- Explicitness of resarch objective or question
- Uniqueness in framing prior research
- Systematicity of method (*)
- Originality of theory
- Novelty of findings

(*) Evaluation criteria and reporting guidelines depend on the method applied. A selection is provided for the following methods. Additional guidelines can be provided upon request.

| Method             | Criteria                           | Reporting guideline                      |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Literature review  | Paré et al. 2015, Paré et al. 2023 | Page et al. 2021, Templier and Paré 2018 |
| Theory development | Gregor 2006                        | -                                        |
| Design Science     | Hevner et al. 2004                 | -                                        |

In addition to reporting the methodological steps, **data and code should be made available** with the thesis according to standards of reproducible research. Corresponding requirements should be discussed with the supervisor and confirmed via e-mail.

<!--
- Experiments (TODO)
- Surveys (TODO)

TBD: methodological coherence/fit?

Weights: We apply flexible weights because the topic of a thesis may limit the degree to which students contributions can excell in any of the contribution dimensions.
-->

The contribution should be **discussed** with reference to

- The (methodological) limitations
- The implications for future research (research gaps)
- The implications for practice (Ågerfalk and Karlsson, 2020).

## Presentation

A presentation is required for Master's theses. A presentation takes 15-20 minutes with 10 minutes of discussion. It receives a weight of 33% and is evaluated based on the following criteria:

- The introductory section should convey why the topic is interesting and it should be easy to follow by a general audience
- The main section should demonstrate the objective, method, main findings, and contribution, giving experts the possibility to critically assess the different parts
- The concluding section should give an outlook and briefly outline the implications
- Presentation style and slides should be appropriate, i.e., using academic terminology, displaying a clear structure, connecting with the audience, taking approx. 2-3 minutes per slide, using short bullet-point summaries instead of longer paragraphs, including illustrations rather than animations
- Questions should be handled constructively, demonstrating in-depth knowledge of the thesis, and familiarity with the broader topic area
