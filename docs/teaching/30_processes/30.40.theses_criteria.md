# Theses: Evaluation criteria

The following section is *work-in-progress*.

Dimensions of contribution (based on Leidner 2020):

- Uniqueness in framing prior research
- Systematicity of method
- Originality of theory
- Novelty of phenomenon
- Extraordinariness of composition

Weights:

We apply flexible weights because the topic of a thesis may limit the degree to which students contributions can excell in any of the contribution dimensions.
