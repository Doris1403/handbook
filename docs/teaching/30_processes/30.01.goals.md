# 30.01 Goals and concept

## Why are we here?

We are fascinated by the **digitalization of work**, which continues to transform our conceptions of office jobs, reasons why we work, and the ways in which we organize resources.
This transformation is exemplified by work-from-home trends and the rise of digital nomads.
Employees are no longer tethered to traditional physical office workspaces, allowing for a more flexible, global, and often more productive work environment.
Furthermore, the emergence of online labor markets, open-source development, and crowdsourcing platforms enable collaborative, transparent, and community-driven models of development and innovation.
With the rise of advanced methods, such as generative artificial intelligence, accessing data, knowledge, and research findings is becoming more fluid and democratized, breaking down barriers to information and empowering a broader spectrum of individuals to contribute to and benefit from collective intelligence.
This dynamic landscape of digital work not only alters how we work but also enriches the tapestry of skills, perspectives, and experiences in the professional world.
Exploring the possible futures of work, each with unique opportunities and challenges, is inherently interesting for students who are about to enter a digital world of work.
