# 30.51 Certificates (Scheine)


## Precondition

Certificates are created in two cases:

1. Students cannot register for an exam via Flexnow, the examination office was asked to activate the registration, and the examination committee has agreed (see [1](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/ism/studium/anmeldung-scheinklausur/))
2. The course has not yet been created in Flexnow

Grading must be completed.

## Process

- The template and scripts for creating certificates is available [here](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/handbook/tree/main/src/scheine).
- Certificates must be printed, signed and stamped.
- Students can pick up the certificates at the secretary's office.
