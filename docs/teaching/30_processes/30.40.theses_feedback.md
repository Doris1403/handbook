# Theses: Feedback

Feedback is essential to improve how we advise students who write a thesis, and it can be helpful for new candidates. Therefore, we actively encourage students to provide feedback. In the process, we ask students whether they want to provide feedback, whether we can publish it, and if so, whether it should be published anonymously.
