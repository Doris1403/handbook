# Theses: Feedback

Feedback is important for students and for us as thesis advisors.
As a student, you may write another thesis or seminar papers. To develop your skills, our goal is to **explain the grading** transparently, and to help you understand which parts of your work could be improved an which ones are adequate or excellent.
For us, feedback sessions are essential to **improve how we advise students** who write a thesis, and it can be helpful for new candidates. 

We actively encourage students to participate in feedback sessions. In the process, we also ask students whether they want to provide feedback, whether we can publish it, and if so, whether it should be published anonymously.
