# Thesis

The thesis is one of the key accomplishments when studying at a University. To support you throughout the process, we provide a clear overview of the steps, transparent evaluation criteria, as well as a developmental approach.
An overview of the process is available [here](theses_process.html) and information on individual theses is recorded internally ([Link](TODO)).

## 1. First contact (Student):

Students can select open topics available on our [website](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/digital-work/studium/abschlussarbeiten/) or suggest topics related to our research areas.
Reach out via e-mail to start the process.

## 2. Initial meeting (Student, Professor):

Appointment with Professor Wagner to discuss topic and next steps.

## 3. Exposé (Student):

Students create an exposé and send it to Professor Wagner and wait for feedback and a meeting date.

## 4. Apply for admission (Student):

Students send the application for admission to the thesis to the *examination office* via their Stud e-mail address. You can use [this e-mail template](theses_admission_mail.html).

## 5. Verification of the admission (Examination Office):

The examination office verifies the admission requirements.

- If admission requirements are met, the topic confirmation is created with text fields so that the topic of the thesis and the date of topic issue can be entered.
- If the admission requirements are not met, the student is notified that the application has been rejected.

## 6. Transmission of the topic confirmation (Examination office):

Transmission of the topic confirmation as a (protected) Word document (.docx) by e-mail to the student together with processing/submission instructions as well as inspection statement with the request to arrange an appointment with the examiner to determine the topic and sign the topic confirmation. At the same time, the examiner or the chair's office receives this message in CC for information.
