# The handbook

The goal of the internal handbook is to document our processes related to 

- Section 10: Lab management
- Section 20: Research
- Section 30: Teaching
- Section 40: Funding
- Section 50: Service

Each section has a unique number, which helps us to organize handbook documents and files on our shared [data store](docs/lab_management/10_processes/10.05.systems-overview.html#nextcloud). For example, theses are in section [30.40](docs/teaching/30_processes/30.40.theses.html). 

## Contributing

We invite everyone to use it as a resource and to contribute to it using the [issues](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/handbook/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/handbook/pulls). Instructions and guidelines are available in [10.10 Handbook](docs/lab_management/10_processes/10.10.handbook.html).
